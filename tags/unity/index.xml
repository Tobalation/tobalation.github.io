      <description>&amp;ldquo;VR bike&amp;rdquo; was a small project that I was contracted by a professor to work on as a developer. The project itself is a very simple and straight forward virtual reality biking game that can be played on a real bicyle with sensor. (on a stationary bike rig of course)
The virtual reality platform that the game was developed was the Samsung Galaxy View. As for sensing the speed of the bicycle, a custom sensor module was created.</description>

      <description>TIDTAR is an acronym for the project I worked on at GISTDA for research purposes during the summer internship of my second year in university. The project was entered in the 2018 Thailand ICT Awards competition but failed to pass the second round, mainly due to criticism of the practicality and usefulness of such an experimental tool. (afterall, the project was done for research but my advisor suggested that the project be entered)</description>
