      <description>&amp;ldquo;VR bike&amp;rdquo; was a small project that I was contracted by a professor to work on as a developer. The project itself is a very simple and straight forward virtual reality biking game that can be played on a real bicyle with sensor. (on a stationary bike rig of course)
The virtual reality platform that the game was developed was the Samsung Galaxy View. As for sensing the speed of the bicycle, a custom sensor module was created.</description>
