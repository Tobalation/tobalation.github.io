      <description>&amp;ldquo;VR bike&amp;rdquo; was a small project that I was contracted by a professor to work on as a developer. The project itself is a very simple and straight forward virtual reality biking game that can be played on a real bicyle with sensor. (on a stationary bike rig of course)
The virtual reality platform that the game was developed was the Samsung Galaxy View. As for sensing the speed of the bicycle, a custom sensor module was created.</description>

      <description>TIDTAR is an acronym for the project I worked on at GISTDA for research purposes during the summer internship of my second year in university. The project was entered in the 2018 Thailand ICT Awards competition.
What is TIDTAR?    TIDTAR (Traffic Information visualization Tool On Augmented Reality) is a experimental tool that was developed for the original Microsoft Hololens for use in the aerospace industry.
It shows local air traffic data of an airport over a certain time period in the form of a holographic miniature with the details and settings all as holograms.</description>
