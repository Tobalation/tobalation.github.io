    <p>&ldquo;VR bike&rdquo; was a small project that I was contracted by a professor to work on as a developer. The project itself is a very simple
and straight forward virtual reality biking game that can be played on a real bicyle with sensor. (on a stationary bike rig of course)</p>
<p>The virtual reality platform that the game was developed was the Samsung Galaxy View. As for sensing the speed of the bicycle, a custom sensor module was created. The module had to be connected to the phone running the game via bluetooth to function.</p>
<p>Lately, this project was also featured at CES 2021.</p>
