    <p>TIDTAR is an acronym for the project I worked on at GISTDA for research purposes during the summer internship of my second year in university.
The project was entered in the 2018 Thailand ICT Awards competition.</p>

<p>TIDTAR (Traffic Information visualization Tool On Augmented Reality) is a experimental tool that was developed for the original Microsoft Hololens for use in the aerospace industry.</p>
<p>It shows local air traffic data of an airport over a certain time period in the form of a holographic miniature with the details and settings all as holograms. The user could interact with the holographic buttons and also repostion the entire miniature airport.
For the demo, air traffic over suvarnabhumi airport for a certain day was shown.</p>

<p>The resolution might seem quite poor, but this was just due to the way screenshots are handled with the orignal hololens.</p>

<p><img src="https://tobalation.github.io/static/images/tidtar-dev.png" alt="wip image" title="An early development screenshot of unity"></p>
<p>The whole project was built using Unity and C#, as it was the most straight forward development platform for the hololens at the time (and the only method I had experience with). The 3D assets were modeled by myself in Blender and some were taken from Microsoft&rsquo;s official Hololens dev-kit.</p>
<p>Aside from the project requirements and timeline, the whole project was handled by myself solo. A big job with several late nights of work and a lot of overtime, but it was quite a worthwhile experience.</p>

<p>After finishing my internship, I am not certain what became of TIDTAR. But to my knowledge the project was shelved and used mainly as a demo for visitors due to it&rsquo;s &ldquo;coolness factor&rdquo;.</p>
